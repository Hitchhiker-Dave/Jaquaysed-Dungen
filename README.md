# Project Info
A node based dungeon generator built in Godot 4.4. Originally made as an Android Compatible app for a mobile development class, before converting to an HTML5 web tool.

The generator itself uses a combination of Delaunay Triangulationm + MST and custom heuristics to generate the maps. To read more about the algorithm's high level logic, [click here](https://wanderingdiejack.blogspot.com/2025/06/generating-jaquaysed-dungeons-15.html)
